      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brian Chan and Vikram Sreedhar are Asian Americans and Anna Chan is British born Chinese and they are all working in various roles across Salesforce. Each of them grew up in different parts of the world and with varying interest in a career in tech. They discuss their journeys into a STEM career and ultimately how they ended up at Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the consequences of the COVID-19 situation has been an increase in the amount of racism aimed at members of various Asian communities. Because of these, each of the speakers has felt an increased responsibility in helping members of their community and others around them. This takes the form of donation, volunteering, or even just educating people on why their behavior could be interpreted as being hostile. What drives them in this work is the goal of raising awareness for these problems and helping improve the diversity for future generations entering tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They conclude with some words of encouragement for people who want to start helping people in their community, whether they come from an Asian background or not. They also provide advice for those coming into tech on how to prepare themselves for success.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Becky Jaimes is a product manager at Salesforce interviewing Dejim Juang, Master Principal Solutions Engineer at Mulesoft. Recently, Dejim wrote an article describing how to connect Mulesoft with Heroku Postgres as a new data source. The main function of Mulesoft is to integrate with various SOA, SaaS, and APIs, and provide developers with a single integration point. Rather than writing entirely new data ingestion software from scratch, Mulesoft does the heavy lifting of connecting to data sources and responding back with the requested information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MuleSoft can be used to build integrations between Salesforce and applications outside of that ecosystem through a drag and drop interface. Some use cases where Mulesoft might not be appropriate include building a BPM tool or managing file transfers. Although Mulesoft certainly has these capabilities, they are too fragile and inefficient to be relied upon heavily. In terms of database connections, you can make RESTful API calls to Mulesoft and have it access information across all of your systems. This is especially useful if your customer data is located in one place and your software data is located somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers can also write their own code to manipulate the data from  disparate sources. They can choose to share their project on the Anypoint Exchange, or continue to use it locally. Although Java is the primary language of choice, there are also scripting choices for JavaScript, Python, .Net, and Ruby. Mulesoft also comes with protections against reporting changes from underlying database migrations, as well as issues with connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Charlie Gleason, a designer and developer at Heroku and Salesforce is in conversation with two members of the non-profit Active for Good: Troy Hickerson, its co-founder, and Luke Mysse, its managing director and brand strategist. Some years ago, Troy and Luke learned about Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food, which is a powdered milk formula designed to provide vitamins and nutrients to malnourished children. Since such a simple product had the potential to help so many lives, they were inspired to find a way to increase its production and distribution. This led to them starting Active for Good. They knew that people weren&amp;#39;t likely to make behavior changes unless there was a motivation. They decided that in order to help people get more fit, the distinguishing feature of their activity-tracking app would be to convert every minute of exercise into points, and those points into RUTF packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://heroku-www-files.s3.amazonaws.com//uploads/762a4547-6509-4038-9f1e-1305213d084d/AFG-kideatingRUTF.jpg" alt="A child eating a RUTF packet"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active for Good has two types of challenges: an open public challenge, where you and your friends can try to meet a goal over the course of 30 days; and company challenges, where a company can invest in their people to encourage more movement. The aim of the app is to minimize screen time, get active, and help real people in the process. Activities aren&amp;#39;t limited to strenuous exercise, either; housework, meditation, and other positive physical movements are also considered. Everyone from individuals to high schools to corporations have found the project useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Troy and Luke understand that changing your habits can be difficult. But they also know that it&amp;#39;s just important to pick an activity and try it. Whether that&amp;#39;s slowly gaining miles on a bike ride, or deciding which philanthropic project to get involved in, the most important thing is to just start doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www2.assets.heroku.com/podcasts/codeish/Codeish_Episode_70_Monitoring_Security and_Privacy_in_Public_Cloud.mp3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Blumen is a DevOps engineer at Salesforce, and he&amp;#39;s interviewing Sean Porter, the CTO of Sensu, a cloud monitoring platform. Monitoring your infrastructure often looks like keeping track of the four golden signals: latency, throughput, error rate, and saturation. To that, Sean advocates identifying data specific catered to security and privacy. For example, with regards to intrusion detection, a company could track the rate at which unauthorized attempts are being made, and where they&amp;#39;re coming from. This could signal potential weak spots in the system or software which malicious actors are probing. Armed with this data and analysis, one could reinforce their security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, intrusion detection is really about monitoring changes to your system&amp;#39;s state. You could take a snapshot of your entire file systems, from permissions of folders to the individual bytes of each binary; by recording the information of a known &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; state, you can track any changes that are occurring. You would be able to identify the rate at which your servers are undergoing configuration drift, or be notified if key system software, such as ssh or ps, have been tampered with. Monitoring your security is about taking a proactive approach to observing any state change on a machine, not necessarily whether unauthorized ports are being sniffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to privacy, you could build some auditing functionality to ensure that you&amp;#39;re not exposing any user information you shouldn&amp;#39;t be.

      <itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Robert Blumen is a DevOps engineer at Salesforce, and he&amp;#39;s interviewing Sean Porter, the CTO of Sensu, a cloud monitoring platform. Monitoring your infrastructure often looks like keeping track of the four golden signals: latency, throughput, error rate, and saturation. To that, Sean advocates identifying data specific catered to security and privacy. For example, with regards to intrusion detection, a company could track the rate at which unauthorized attempts are being made, and where they&amp;#39;re coming from. This could signal potential weak spots in the system or software which malicious actors are probing. Armed with this data and analysis, one could reinforce their security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, intrusion detection is really about monitoring changes to your system&amp;#39;s state. You could take a snapshot of your entire file systems, from permissions of folders to the individual bytes of each binary; by recording the information of a known &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; state, you can track any changes that are occurring. You would be able to identify the rate at which your servers are undergoing configuration drift, or be notified if key system software, such as ssh or ps, have been tampered with. Monitoring your security is about taking a proactive approach to observing any state change on a machine, not necessarily whether unauthorized ports are being sniffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to privacy, you could build some auditing functionality to ensure that you&amp;#39;re not exposing any user information you shouldn&amp;#39;t be. One approach might be to monitor whether numbers that look like a credit card are being accidentally showing up in your logs. It&amp;#39;s also important to be mindful of compliance with regulations like GDPR.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Castle, a developer advocate at Salesforce, is joined by Evan Grim, a software architect at Salesforce responsible for the Salesforce Authenticator mobile app. Salesforce Authenticator is a component of a two-factor authentication flow. After a user signs in to their Salesforce organization, the mobile app will generate a secure code which is used to provide additional verification. This guarantees that even if a user&amp;#39;s password is compromised, a hacker won&amp;#39;t be able to login unless they have access to your phone, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiencing a flow like this has become commonplace, with banks and other websites taking a security-first approach to their user experience. What&amp;#39;s starting to change is the way these 2FA apps work. For example, Evan has built a flow where the Salesforce Authenticator uses geolocation to identify where you are. If you log in to a website from the same location enough times to establish a pattern, the app can send the security code automatically, without you needing to type anything in. Evan is very interested in exploring further trends where safety is not compromised for the sake of usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the remainder of the episode, Chris and Evan discuss the fundamentals of the technologies and systems used to build the app. Evan believes that keeping things simple is paramount to any software project. For many years, the Salesforce Authenticator backend was situated in one region, and it served them well. Now that the app has become more popular, they are considering the complexities of multi-region support, including sharding their Postgres database. Their trade-off for focusing on adoption over sophistication has paid off, as it often does. Now that their idea has been validated, they can plan to rearchitect their app to support increased volume from a growing security-conscious user base.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Charlie Gleason, a designer and developer at Heroku, is in conversation with Ben Harding, a developer at Raygun. Their conversation centers around a website&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;critical render path,&amp;quot; which are the steps in which HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are converted into pixels which a user actually interacts with in their browser. The fast these pixels are rendered, the better the experience which a user receives. Delays in website rendering can lead to an impact on one&amp;#39;s business, as users are likely to leave slow sites; more often, it&amp;#39;s an issue of accessibility, where users with slower connections should be able to visit any page they want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben outlines four metrics that can be key to gathering information about how your website is performing. There&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;time to first paint,&amp;quot; which is the time it takes for a browser to render anything; there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;time to first contentful paint,&amp;quot; which is the time it takes for the browser to render any content, like an image or text; there&amp;#39;s load time, which is the time it takes for all of your assets--CSS, JavaScript, and fonts--to download; and there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;time to interactive,&amp;quot; which is when a user can start engaging with a website, such as by clicking buttons or filling out a form. It&amp;#39;s important to measure all of these stats first so that you can approach performance optimizations from a baseline of where you are, and where you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s plenty of low-hanging fruit when it comes to improving website rendering performance. You could try minifying and compressing your CSS, JavaScript, and images, so that the user&amp;#39;s browser doesn&amp;#39;t need to fetch large files. You can also implement techniques such as code splitting, which ensures that CSS and JavaScript is only loaded for the pages those styles or functions are needed on, rather than every single page on your site. You can load your assets asynchronously, so that the browser is not blocked on any one task. The important thing is to take a look at your starting metrics, and focus on tackling one of your problems until the load times are down to an acceptable range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine-tuning website performance is an iterative cycle: as more features are added, performance will degrade. Sometimes you can&amp;#39;t optimize a website any further than you&amp;#39;ve already done, and that&amp;#39;s okay. As long as you keep your user&amp;#39;s perceived performance in mind, you can still get away with having spinners and splash screens, so long as they are receiving feedback and are aware that something is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

      <googleplay:description>&lt;p&gt;Charlie Gleason, a designer and developer at Heroku, is in conversation with Ben Harding, a developer at Raygun. Their conversation centers around a website&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;critical render path,&amp;quot; which are the steps in which HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are converted into pixels which a user actually interacts with in their browser. The fast these pixels are rendered, the better the experience which a user receives. Delays in website rendering can lead to an impact on one&amp;#39;s business, as users are likely to leave slow sites; more often, it&amp;#39;s an issue of accessibility, where users with slower connections should be able to visit any page they want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben outlines four metrics that can be key to gathering information about how your website is performing. There&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;time to first paint,&amp;quot; which is the time it takes for a browser to render anything; there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;time to first contentful paint,&amp;quot; which is the time it takes for the browser to render any content, like an image or text; there&amp;#39;s load time, which is the time it takes for all of your assets--CSS, JavaScript, and fonts--to download; and there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;time to interactive,&amp;quot; which is when a user can start engaging with a website, such as by clicking buttons or filling out a form. It&amp;#39;s important to measure all of these stats first so that you can approach performance optimizations from a baseline of where you are, and where you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s plenty of low-hanging fruit when it comes to improving website rendering performance. You could try minifying and compressing your CSS, JavaScript, and images, so that the user&amp;#39;s browser doesn&amp;#39;t need to fetch large files. You can also implement techniques such as code splitting, which ensures that CSS and JavaScript is only loaded for the pages those styles or functions are needed on, rather than every single page on your site. You can load your assets asynchronously, so that the browser is not blocked on any one task. The important thing is to take a look at your starting metrics, and focus on tackling one of your problems until the load times are down to an acceptable range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine-tuning website performance is an iterative cycle: as more features are added, performance will degrade. Sometimes you can&amp;#39;t optimize a website any further than you&amp;#39;ve already done, and that&amp;#39;s okay. As long as you keep your user&amp;#39;s perceived performance in mind, you can still get away with having spinners and splash screens, so long as they are receiving feedback and are aware that something is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Corey Martin, a customer solutions architect at Heroku, is in conversation with Jason Meller, the founder and CEO of Kolide, to talk about the future of enterprise security software. Kolide is a device monitoring software with an emphasis on its users. By and large, devices which are part of the Kolide fleet are free to operate unrestricted, whether that&amp;#39;s downloading files or disabling firewalls. However, Kolide lets users know when they&amp;#39;re engaging in potentially insecure behaviors, through Slack messages and OS notifications. It places the responsibility and trust for safety onto the user, rather than locking everything down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason came up with the idea for Kolide after working at GE. As an enormous enterprise company, GE had to ensure that its employees&amp;#39; devices were always secure, to prevent outside threats from infiltrating their network. While realizing the importance of keeping users safe, he disliked the invasiveness of existing tools, not to mention that their approaches hindered necessary applications and services employees used to be successful at their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User focused security, which is what Kolide practices, starts with empathy. This comes about by visualizing the needs of people that are using the devices every day and trying to understand where risks might exist there, from the entire chain of users.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Corey Martin, a customer solutions architect at Heroku, is joined in conversation with Bryan Woods, the CTO of a platform called Rhino. Rhino is a simple CRUD app with an enormous responsibility. Typically, individuals need to pay thousands of dollars upfront when renting an apartment, to cover any damages and liabilities. Instead, Rhino charges renters--98% of whom are responsible and get their deposits back--a small monthly fee, and sends those payments directly to property holders. Landlords are protected and renters save money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the idea is easy to understand, the effort to launch the product required working with established regulations. One of the co-founders also had to license themselves as an agent who can sell insurance, just to be able to operate within city and state laws. Yet unlike many other startups, Bryan sees regulation as something to embrace, not skirt. By working with regulators, Rhino has been able to establish the rules for how they operate, as well as nearly guarantee a competitive advantage by being the only company operating in the insurance space in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with many other startups, relying on established frameworks like Rails and stable platforms like Heroku have enabled Bryan and his team to focus on building a great product, not worry about implementation or uptime. Bryan also encourages other entrepreneurs working in heavily regulated spaces to trust in themselves and continue pushing through existing red tape. Rather than building something cheap and fast, truly revolutionary ideas will take time to convince others--particularly if legal requirements are already in place--but once you prove the idea you can become a leader in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Erin Allard, a Platform Support Engineer at Heroku, interviews Philippe Vanderstigel, who has launched several start-ups, most recently, RocketChart. RocketChart is a cash flow management and forecast software solution for businesses, and while it&amp;#39;s been a success, it wasn&amp;#39;t Philippe&amp;#39;s first attempt. He&amp;#39;s built products that managed online gaming subscriptions to selling sausages online. Some of these ideas worked, and others didn&amp;#39;t. Undeterred, Philippe mocked up an image of what he envisioned a budgeting app to look like, and within twenty-four hours had hundreds of people expressing interest in an app that didn&amp;#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philippe talks about the difficulties involved starting any business, namely raising funds and validating your ideas. Philippe very strongly believes that founders need to be directly engaged with their customers, especially in the early stages of the business. He personally responds to every message he receives, and asks direct questions to his users about what features they would like to see before his team spends time building them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of particular importance to Philippe is managing the expectations of his users. He is the only one working full-time on RocketChart; the other two employees, his friend Elie and brother Marc, have day jobs to pay their bills. What this results in is a very calculated and gradual acceptance of new users, which also receive direct one-on-one correspondence with Philippe. This also makes it easier to divide the workload, so that the three of them can continue building a sustainable business without taking outside funding.&lt;/p&gt;

He is the only one working full-time on RocketChart; the other two employees, his friend Elie and brother Marc, have day jobs to pay their bills. What this results in is a very calculated and gradual acceptance of new users, which also receive direct one-on-one correspondence with Philippe. This also makes it easier to divide the workload, so that the three of them can continue building a sustainable business without taking outside funding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Blaine Kaho`onei is an Alliances Director for Heroku; he also sits on the board for Purple Mai`a, an online learning platform bringing technology skillsets to the native Hawaiian community. He&amp;#39;s joined in conversation by David Pickett, a software developer and lead instructor with Purple Mai`a, as well as Jennifer Hooper, Heroku&amp;#39;s Technical Product Marketing, Content, and Brand Director, who has also volunteered at Purple Mai`a. Blaine begins the dialog by talking about his interest in bringing together Hawaii&amp;#39;s rich history of innovation and technological development with its indigenous culture. There aren&amp;#39;t many economic opportunities for native families in Hawaii, nor are they programs designed to provide the youth with a valuable technical skill set. Most people with coding or design skills have felt the need to move away, furthering splintering the Hawaiian community. Blaine and David are keen to establish a tech hub in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blaine Kaho`onei is an Alliances Director for Heroku; he also sits on the board for Purple Mai`a, an educational non-profit, whose mission is to educate and inspire the native Hawaiian community through cultural, social and enterprise technologies.

&lt;p&gt;To accomplish that mission, Purple Mai`a&amp;#39;s main focus is on middle school-aged students in classrooms. Volunteers and staff teach students on a range of topics, from coding and computer science fundamentals to user experience design and graphics design. In order to work towards assisting as many students as possible, David saw the need for incorporating a learning management system. Unable to find one that was centered on the student, they built their own platform called Haumana in 2017. They wanted it to be a tool for students to learn through what they&amp;#39;re motivated about. This platform was in-use for in-person classes and is now being used for remote-only classes.
Jennifer became involved in the program by volunteering her time answering questions on what a career in tech looks like. She also provides feedback on students&amp;#39; projects, and teaches them ways outside of the classroom to work on themselves, such as maintaining a LinkedIn profile. She has also provided insights into how Haumana can better achieve its goals with the critical perspective of an outside user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many more classrooms are moving their curriculum online, whether by choice or circumstance. Purple Mai`a&amp;#39;s ability to adapt, innovate, and embrace change on the fly have served Hawaiian teachers and students well over the years. Their emphasis on bridging Hawaiian culture with a valuable education provides them with a unique opportunity that they&amp;#39;ve ultimately succeeded at.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sandy Lai is a customer solutions architect at Heroku, and she is interviewing two employees at Panorama Education: Ben Small, a software engineer, and Mitch Peabody, an engineering manager. Panorama is a platform designed to help educators, teachers, and principals, understand their students and their community by offering feedback surveys. As different schools have different technical expertise in their districts, Panorama caters its product to meet those needs. Different schools have different systems in place--sometimes as many as two or three different platforms in the same district--and Panorama built technology to pull that disparate data into one location to provide holistic (and individual) views into the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team at Panorama has found that schools largely rely on paper as they&amp;#39;re extremely cautious about the data that is being shared on the kids in their classrooms. Security and privacy are top priorities for everyone at Panorama, from the CEO on down. They established a security working group to meet once a week and commit to making sure that security best practices are being taught and followed across the company. They also offer annual training for all employees on how to protect customer data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panorama&amp;#39;s currently tackling challenges around scaling, both from its customers and as the business itself hires more employees. There is a certain seasonality to their work, where the Spring and Fall months tend to be the most active months on the platform. There&amp;#39;s also the issue of timing, where hundreds of thousands of users log in at around the same time. To help offset this, Panorama rolls feature changes out across timezones. That is, when the schools on America&amp;#39;s East Coast are finished around 3pm, new updates are deployed for that region, a process that continues westward. This way, they&amp;#39;re able to ensure reliability without disruption to the future time zones for their end-of-day rush.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Charlie Gleason, a designer at Heroku and Salesforce, sits down for a special conversation with Margaret Francis, the SVP of Platform Data Services. Their conversation is around the unavoidable topic of COVID-19, quarantines, and the disruptions to normal life around the world. Margaret starts the conversation by briefly contextualizing the event against two other catastrophes she experienced: the DotCom Crash of 2000, and the Global Financial Meltdown of 2008. While those two incidents had very real consequences to the tech, real estate, and banking industries, this current pandemic feels different, not the least of which being that every facet of life has been disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Margaret and Charlie keep their spirits up in a variety of ways. It&amp;#39;s important to be radically honest with your family and coworkers about difficulties you&amp;#39;re experiencing. You may just find that others have similar feelings, and sharing these thoughts can create stronger bonds of empathy. It&amp;#39;s important too to try and find new ways every day to laugh, whether that&amp;#39;s trying out a ridiculous haircut, or finding nonsensical videos online. Margaret advises trying to reconnect with a hobby you just haven&amp;#39;t done in a long time. For her, that&amp;#39;s reading, and she&amp;#39;s recently picked up some of her favorite books that she knows will bring her joy. Trying out new activities can also lead you towards discovering new hobbies to enjoy, too, such as baking or sewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will one day be out of quarantine, and the pair pontificate on what that might mean for societies across the globe. Change seems inevitable, whether that means the MTA will continue its recent practice of scrubbing New York City subway cars clean, or the continued extension of safety nets that governments are establishing. No matter what, it&amp;#39;s important to try and keep touch with friends and family, and to keep in mind that when this is all over, we will hug each other once again.&lt;/p&gt;

Luis is a data analyst intern at Heroku, and he got there through his involvement in Year Up. Year Up is akin to a bootcamp for young adults, divided into two phases. The first six months are a process of learning and development. Year Up pairs your interests with hands-on training in various subjects, such as data analytics, IT, and project management. There&amp;#39;s consistent feedback from your classmates and you&amp;#39;re constantly being evaluated on your progress. After this assessment, Year Up pairs students with companies. For example, students who excelled in data visualization courses will be matched to a company which requires that work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luis carries the discussion by listing out the aspects of Year Up which surprised him. He appreciated the amount of time which his mentors at Heroku allotted for him, and was able to make the commute from San Jose to San Francisco largely because Year Up provides a monthly stipend for all of its students. Learning to anticipate his colleagues&amp;#39; needs was also necessary, as Luis&amp;#39; primary role was collating and representing data as graphs for others to make use of. Through the process, Luis was able to solidify his communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, Luis offers some advice for listeners who are keen to become future interns. He believes prospective Year Up students network should with as many people as they can, to ask for and suggest projects that coincide with their interests. Next, when it comes time to apply for jobs, he recommends an aggressive approach of applying to no less than three openings a day. As well, if you document the work you&amp;#39;ve been doing, you will find yourself with a portfolio which you can show to prospective employers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julián Duque, a developer advocate at Heroku, interviews Nate Beck, the principal architect and founder of Pretzel Tech. Pretzel Tech is a company which has built Pretzel Rocks, a service that allows livestreamers to safely use licensed music. They do so by wrangling the needs of three different customers: broadcasters, who want to play fun music; record labels, which hold the rights to artists&amp;#39; music; and viewers, who want to play the same music at the same time as the broadcaster they are watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical ability to stream music is not terribly difficult; but the challenge lies in fanning that out, to thousands of listeners, all at once. When a streamer logs in, 20,000 users might get notified and jump onto the stream all at once within seconds. Pretzel deals with these network spikes in several ways. Although their backend is a basic Rails app hosted on Heroku, they use Lambda to handle the broadcast, as they don&amp;#39;t have a constant stream of traffic requiring many dynos. They use a CDN with plenty of POPs around the world to host the music, ensuring that it&amp;#39;s fast and stable for users. Other difficulties including dealing with the music industry. For a single popular song, Nate needs to coordinates with 28 different companies to agree on a licensing rate. The industry also uses a standard called DDEX, which is an XML format to track metadata for artists, albums, and releases. This requires a custom pipeline to parse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, Nate has nothing but praise for Twitch&amp;#39;s API platform. The company is very community focused, with a public roadmap and excellent documentation for integratos. Its users often have plenty of positive feedback for Pretzel and other extensions. Pretzel&amp;#39;s main focus right now is on ensuring the financial success for artists on the broadcasts of their music.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Parker Phinney, creator of Interview Cake, continues his discussion from a previous episode with Julián Duque, a developer advocate at Heroku. Interview Cake provides different interview questions and programming exercise that adapt to the programming language that a candidate is working on. Since their coursework is essential to helping users succeed, they made an effort to ensure that the work was done accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they provided their entire course curriculum in Python, the programming language they were most familiar with. Then, they hired a team of language experts to convert those Python lessons into various other languages. Finally, they hired a second team of experts to review the work of the first team. This two-pass system allowed them to bootstrap expertise in almost a dozen different languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parker continues by discussing some of the challenges involved in this system, including keeping track of the work and managing the funds for various individuals. He also talks about various improvements they are making to the pipeline for their next iteration of content.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join Charlie Gleason, a designer and developer at Heroku, as he interviews two people representing The Difference Engine: Kimberly Lowe-Williams, its founder and Executive Director, and Rachel Marro, a recent graduate. The Difference Engine is a Chicago-based nonprofit with the goal of empowering professionals from nontraditional backgrounds to launch their careers in tech. They do this through an apprenticeship web development program, mock technical interviews, and ways to highlight their relevant experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kimberley stresses that The Difference Engine expects applicants to have some familiarity with coding. The programs are designed to help adults with prior work experience navigate the often insular and nepotistic tech industry. One of her biggest tips is to encourage individuals to attend meet-ups, conferences, and other information sessions, to connect with others from similar backgrounds. Rachel concurs; it wasn&amp;#39;t until she joined a few Slack groups that she realized her predicament was not unique, and it gave her more confidence in pursuing her career change into tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although just over three years old, The Difference Engine has already placed several apprentices into tech careers. One of Kimberley&amp;#39;s goals for 2020 is to involve more corporate sponsorship, in two forms. First, The Difference Engine can guide tech companies in reevaluating their interview practices to eliminate unconscious biases. Second, employees at companies can volunteer their time to serve as mentors for apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Erin Allard is a Platform Support Engineer at Heroku, and she&amp;#39;s interviewing Ben Orenstein, one of the co-founders of Tuple. Screenshare was a popular pair programming app that was discontinued after being acquired by Slack. Finding no other alternative for this functionality, Ben and his friends built Tuple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben spent much of the early months of Tuple investigating pricing strategies, because he understood that the business wouldn&amp;#39;t exist unless he could charge a reasonable price customers would be willing to pay. This process also reduced the risk of their efforts, knowing that they could burn through months of savings with the likely goal of being able to turn a profit.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Giorgio Regni, the co-founder and CTO of Scality, and Robert Blumen, a DevOps engineer at Salesforce, cover the basics of on prem, public cloud, private cloud and multi-cloud.  The discussion covers business drivers, use cases, division of workloads, architecture, and networking concerns present in each of these categories.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, there is no &amp;quot;one cloud fits all&amp;quot; approach to building applications.  The public cloud is more than an experimental platform for non-critical applications and unproven products - nor is the path of all computing migrating to its final home in the public cloud inevitable. Instead enterprises are arriving at the right mix of on premises private clouds which are increasingly containers providing APIs, and one or more public clouds.  The motivations for selecting a cloud type can be vertical best-of-breed based on the offerings of a specific cloud provider, distributing peak capacity at lower cost, off site disaster recovery, or choosing a mix of vendors to avoid lock in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mixed model works conceptually, but it also introduces issues around security, privacy, and the ability of enterprises to meet service level agreements. Increasingly, companies are grappling with integrating authentication solutions for these disparate locations. As a cloud storage provider, Giorgio provides his insights on how companies are building out these infrastructures and the tools they use to solve their problems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;David Morganthaler, an Account Manager at Heroku, interviews two members from Kevala: Emmanuel Levijarvi, its engineering lead, and Teddy Ward, a software engineer. Kevala is building a one-to-one map of a community&amp;#39;s energy grid, to identify how power is produced and model how it&amp;#39;s consumed. They pull data from public sources and aggregate data to reliably predict when energy will be needed, and what an optimal price to pay for that energy generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing the exact amount of energy that people want alongside the amount that is being produced is an incredibly hard problem for the utility sector. If you don&amp;#39;t produce enough, electronics won&amp;#39;t work and vehicles can&amp;#39;t be charged; if you produce too much, it&amp;#39;s either wasted or has the potential to fry wiring and infrastructure. Kevala tries to monitor these figures by using machine learning on models they create, as well as tracking usage throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kevala engineers spend some time also talking about the dependencies used to achieve their goals. These range from hardware, like the IoT devices which consumers install or the access points they tap into to collect accurate data, as well as the software services which make up their app, like Auth0 and Postgres. Because of the unreliable nature of energy consumption, Heroku&amp;#39;s autoscaling platform allows Kevala itself to spin up resources in a cost-effective manner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mike Mondragon interviews Bret Fisher, who works as a freelance DevOps/sysadmin consultant, and who also has the designation of being a Docker Captain. Docker Captain is a distinction that Docker awards select members of the community that are Docker experts and are passionate about sharing their Docker knowledge with others. To that end, Bret walks us through the history of how he became involved in Docker, and indeed, the history of Docker itself: the problems it tried to solve, and the way the codebase evolved to provide those solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the conversation centers around the confusing terminology and processes present in the Docker ecosystem: when to use Docker Compose, the differences between running Docker locally and in production, and when to consider adopting Kubernetes. There are also various container runtimes which developers can make use of, and Bret touches on the characteristics of each as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bret looks towards the future of Docker, the company, as they recently sold off a portion of their enterprise-focused business. Docker is returning to its original intent to provide developers with better tooling to deploy and isolate their applications. He urges caution to teams ready to move wholeheartedly to Docker and instead focus on solutions that match their problems, not those of immense enterprise corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Corey Martin is a Customer Solutions Architect at Heroku. On this episode of Code[ish], he’s interviewing Joe Leo, the founder and CEO of Def Method, a service-oriented software consultancy based out of New York City. The conversation begins with Leo providing his personal definition of legacy software as being any software that is not currently in the process of being written. He emphasizes that this does not mean something is immediately obsolete once it’s been written, but that at that point an individual or company must shift its energy and focus to maintenance and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there Martin and Leo move on to discussing how customers Def Method helps customers find solutions to their software issues. Whether a company is dealing with brownfield, greenfield or minefield software, Def Method attempts to help them determine how to deal with the problems they are faced with and how they can keep their system healthy as they continue to evolve. As Leo points out, no piece of software is future-proof or bug-free, so honesty and openness are required if a company wants to succeed. It’s Def Method’s goal to help its customers get to this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pair round out the conversation by talking about Leo’s recent book, The Well-Grounded Rubyist. The text, which was originally penned by Leo’s close friend David A. Black, is considered one of the most influential pieces of writing on Ruby and Leo was brought in to help co-author the third edition, which is published by Manning Publications. Leo views The Well-Grounded Rubyist as a text book with a philosophical bent and says that his primary focus was capturing the how the language has developed throughout its history and the very real tectonic shifts it has undergone during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mike Mondragon is the Lead Member of Technical Staff at Heroku. He&amp;#39;s interviewing Ben Curtis, one of the co-founders of Honeybadger.io, which is an exception monitoring service for web developers. Curtis reminisces about how he came to Ruby through Rails during the early 2000s. Having already spent a few years as a web developer, he says he quickly fell in love with Ruby because everything he had learned, from templating and database abstraction layers, were built into its framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation then moves on to the founding of Honeybadger. Its genesis came when Curtis and one of the company’s other co-founders, Starre Horne, were working together at a startup building a Rails app and were using Airbrake to track exceptions. Frustrated by the lack of detail they were getting in their descriptions, they used Airbrake’s published code to create a new tool that would provide developers with a more thorough breakdown of what was happening. Initially, there was some pushback creating the project, but Curtis, a longtime proponent of open source, believes that Honeybadger’s development was in keeping with the ethos of open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, the conversation moves on to a general discussion about the benefits of side projects both as a creative outlet and as a means to solve problems. Curtis said his approach to side projects has evolved over the years, and while he still does them for fun each project needs to be something he is willing to put his time and effort into regardless of whether other people will care. From there the interview moves on to discussion about burnout and the importance of a positive work-life balance, something which the entire Honeybadger.io team is very mindful of. Curtis concludes by saying that in the end the most important aspect of side projects is creating something that is your own.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mike Mondragon is interviewing Geoffrey Grosenbach, the Director of Product Education at Hashicorp. Before that, he launched PeepCode in 2006, a platform for developers to share and sell screencasts of programing tutorials. Over the years, he was able to grow the company until its acquisition by Pluralsight; he describes what the experience was like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation turns towards how to best learn new programming skills, after you&amp;#39;ve plateaued to being a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; developer. Geoffrey suggests two things. First, writing about something you&amp;#39;re working on is a good way to experience how you might express concepts to someone learning about them for the first time. He also recommends that developers step out of their comfort zone. For example, if you know how to &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; to Heroku, perhaps you could try writing your own buildpack next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the episode, Mike and Geoffrey discuss the effects of attention, particularly around social media. The more you produce helpful content—whether that&amp;#39;s an article, a video, or an open source project—you&amp;#39;re bound to attract others. Finding that balance of joy and sanity can be a difficult one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julián Duque is a senior developer advocate at the Heroku, and he&amp;#39;s interviewing Luca Maraschi, a chief architect at TELUS Digital. TELUS is a large communications company in Canada, which processes a massive amount of data produced by millions of customers all across the country. One of their challenges, for example, was to design a single datastore which provided a consistent experience across online services and offline ones, such as call centers or brick-and-mortar stores. In the end, Luca describes how they were able to break apart the existing monolith in favor many different microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luca notes that the data sources are not uniform; they can be coming from Excel files, Cassandra clusters, PostgresQL, MongoDB, and so on. He talks about the technologies they used to accomplish this feat, settling on GraphQL as a main component to the stack, as their services already act as edges in a graph. TELUS also makes use of Kuma and Kong, two relatively new projects. Luca finds new technologies to be not something to necessarily be afraid of, but rather, because they are often open source software, to make use of them as opportunities for driving the project&amp;#39;s decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation wraps up with a discussion on the future of distributed systems. In the end, Luca believes that more responsibility for data manipulation should be placed on the client, rather the server identifying what it believes to be the &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; data set. This allows for greater flexibility, and opportunities for changing backend strategies as needs evolve, without user-facing disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation wraps up with a discussion on the future of distributed systems. In the end, Luca believes that more responsibility for data manipulation should be placed on the client, rather the server identifying what it believes to be the &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; data set. This allows for greater flexibility, and opportunities for changing backend strategies as needs evolve, without user-facing disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Corey Martin is a Customer Solutions Architect at Heroku. He’s interviewing Adam McCrea, a software developer and the creator of Rails Autoscale, a Heroku add-on that allows developers to auto-scale their Ruby On Rails apps. They begin their conversation by talking about auto-scaling and how McCrea’s experience as a developer inspired him to create an application that would automatically handle the scaling of web and worker dynos. Having seen how valuable the initial app was for the company he worked for, McCrea set about turning his creation into a sellable product that could be used by other developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re working with more than one Heroku dyno, there’s a lot of guesswork involved in scaling resources. Rails Autoscale takes care of this problem, by automatically determining how many dynos an app needs, scaling them up when required and down when there is excess capacity, all in real-time. By using an app to take care of the process, McCrea knows that a vitally important process is taken care of regardless of fluctuations through the day or week, saving users money and providing peace of mind. The app also measures requests queuing time, as opposed to total response time, which provides a more accurate indication of real-time capacity requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin and McCrea round out their conversation by talking about McCrea’s experiences turning his application into a sellable product and how the Heroku Elements Marketplace has helped him get Rails Autoscaling into the hands of over 200 paying customers. McCrea says that as with everything there are trade-offs, but not having to worry about marketing Rails Autoscaling or handle billing have made the experience easily worthwhile for him. Finally, McCrea explains his attempts to further spread word about Rails Autoscaling, including engaging with the bootstrapper community on Twitter and attending conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julián Duque is a senior developer advocate here at Heroku. He attended the NodeConf EU conference in Ireland, and met up with Ruben Bridgewater, a software architect and core Node.js contributor. Julián and Ruben go over the history of Node.js (now in its tenth year), as well as how Ruben became involved with the Node.js project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruben&amp;#39;s focus on Node is providing its users with good developer experiences. As a consultant, he has seen how organizations frequently run into the same issues over and over. JavaScript is partly to blame here, as there are three different patterns for executing asynchronous logic: callbacks, promises, and the new async/await syntactic sugar. He&amp;#39;d like to help people avoid problems by strengthening their understanding around proper error handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruben has several suggestions. First, he advises everyone to switch to using the async/await pattern of asynchronous code execution, which was introduced in Node 12. This allows errors to provide an async stack trace, which is more helpful in diagnosing errors than the obfuscated errors that come from promises. Second, he advises teams not to simply try-catch and rethrow errors. It&amp;#39;s far more beneficial to abstract errors into individual classes (&lt;code&gt;NotFoundError&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NotPermittedError&lt;/code&gt;, etc), because it allows the programmer to identify immediately from the error name what went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this abstraction, Julián and Ruben discuss its role in logging strategies. By having your errors defined as distinct classes, you can place all sorts of &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; information in them as properties, such as the status code. With no additional programming labor, this data can be exposed in the logs for additional analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, the best thing you can do is to think about errors while writing the code. For example, add tests for all the edge cases you may encounter. By investing more time upfront in the development process, you will save yourself from worries later on when the code hits production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anthony Mazzarella, a senior engineering manager at Heroku, is joined by Juan Pablo Buriticá the VP of engineering at Splice. Juan Pablo has spent the last decade building and running engineering teams across different industries. He believes in helping engineers find their role in fulfilling a business&amp;#39; higher level initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juan Pablo encourages teams to focus on planning just a little bit ahead of where you envision your business will be, in order to avoid much greater pains. This includes establishing communication channels that are agreed upon, even if your team is rather small. This way, there will be less ambiguity about where decisions are discussed, should your team grow in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to validate your successes, you need metrics to keep track of how your team is doing. Juan Pablo recommends four: how long it takes for a feature, from its first commit, to release to production; how long it takes to recover from an outage; how often you introduce new errors into production; and how often you&amp;#39;re deploying code to production. By measuring these ideas, iterating on them, and introducing new metrics, the entire businesses—not just the engineers—can understand their role in the health of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the utmost priority for any business should be to satisfy their customers. It is worth paying someone else to solve any problem which deviates from this goal. That includes relying on Heroku for infrastructure and LaunchDarkly to handle feature flags. Tackling interesting technical problems is ultimately going to cost a company money anyway, as engineering time will be diverted away from helping a customer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alex Korzhikov is an engineer at ING Bank. He&amp;#39;s at NodeConf to lead a workshop on using oclif, as well as working with classes and OOP in TypeScript. oclif is a command-line framework developed in TypeScript by Heroku, and ING is using several different tools built on oclif to communicate with each other. He talks with Julián about why they chose oclif, and how TypeScript has enabled them to build better systems faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tierney Cyren works as a developer advocate for Microsoft Azure. He&amp;#39;s also the Chairperson of the Community Committee for Node.js. He&amp;#39;s passionate about helping open source communities become more inclusive by helping them work on internationalization, documentation, and various governance needs. His talk is centered on four factors he&amp;#39;s found are fundamental to growing a successful and healthy open source project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Dickinson is building Entropic, a new package manager for Node.js. As opposed to npm, Entropic is comprised of federated hubs, ensuring that no single company or entity is responsible for all of the community&amp;#39;s third-party packages. Previously, he worked on NPM itself, and knows first-hand how much a a distributed system is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Blumen is a Dev Ops engineer at Salesforce. He&amp;#39;s interviewing Alexey Syomichev, a software engineering principle architect at Salesforce, with over 25 years of experience. Their conversation begins with what constitutes an event (an immutable record encoding something that happened to an app). They then move on to describe consumers of those events, whether they&amp;#39;re internal to an app or external to other services and business departments. Finally, they discuss ways in which you can store that event, either in a database or a running event log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Databases and event logs each have their strengths and weaknesses, which Alexey enumerates. Event logs, for example, are easier to write to; but databases are easier to query for information. In general, Alexey believes that it can be important to organize your larger systems around an event log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation concludes with a discussion on how to use an event log in practical ways. First, you&amp;#39;ll need to decide the schema to use when representing an event. State transitions are another reality to consider. If multiple events representing the same action come in, you need to make sure that the event log is atomic. Finally, there&amp;#39;s a question of precisely how many events to retain, how far back you store your application&amp;#39;s state.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Johnny Boursiquot is an SRE at Heroku, and joining him on this episode are Ed Muller (one-time Go language owner at Heroku), and Rishabh Wason, an engineer fresh out of university. Ed initiates the conversation by talking about how Heroku rolls out buildpack updates to users that are concurrent with Go releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku is a polyglot organization, and Go is being used as one of its four primary languages. It&amp;#39;s finding its way into backends, microservices, and services which communicate with each other. Since many engineers at Heroku have experience in multiple languages, it&amp;#39;s become essential for Go experts to teach others how to write idiomatic Go code. Part of this is done through the Go Design Guide, a living document that details the pros and cons of various ways to write Go logic. Ed in particular finds that pairing with other engineers on their issues has helped him understand a beginner&amp;#39;s mindset, which he can then use to update internal documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rishab also shares his strategies for how he learned Go, coming at it with prior experience in Java and Python. He provides a list of online resources which helped him. He also talks about some of the discrepancies he found in different code bases--for example, in their different dependency management styles. For him, the way in which he grew his understanding of the language was to ask targeted questions to reviewers in his pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

      <googleplay:description>&lt;p&gt;Johnny Boursiquot is an SRE at Heroku, and joining him on this episode are Ed Muller (one-time Go language owner at Heroku), and Rishabh Wason, an engineer fresh out of university. Ed initiates the conversation by talking about how Heroku rolls out buildpack updates to users that are concurrent with Go releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku is a polyglot organization, and Go is being used as one of its four primary languages. It&amp;#39;s finding its way into backends, microservices, and services which communicate with each other. Since many engineers at Heroku have experience in multiple languages, it&amp;#39;s become essential for Go experts to teach others how to write idiomatic Go code. Part of this is done through the Go Design Guide, a living document that details the pros and cons of various ways to write Go logic. Ed in particular finds that pairing with other engineers on their issues has helped him understand a beginner&amp;#39;s mindset, which he can then use to update internal documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rishab also shares his strategies for how he learned Go, coming at it with prior experience in Java and Python. He provides a list of online resources which helped him. He also talks about some of the discrepancies he found in different code bases--for example, in their different dependency management styles. For him, the way in which he grew his understanding of the language was to ask targeted questions to reviewers in his pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Casey Faist, Heroku&amp;#39;s Python Buildpack Maintainer, sits down with Justin Kestler, the co-founder of LitCharts, and Devyn Gasperini, one of its full stack web developers. They discuss the genesis of the project, and how it&amp;#39;s really an evolution of Web 2.0 sites such as SparkNotes. LitCharts differentiates itself by providing modern English translations of well-known literary works, as well as color highlighting and annotating content word by word. Through a clever use of hyperlinks, they can also cite intrareferential and interreferential materials. This has the end result of producing thorough analyses between 8,000 and 10,000 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the work developing LitCharts has centered around user experience and user feedback. The LitCharts team strives to not only provide a pleasing experience for the end user, but also a feature-rich interface for the writers providing annotations. Their end goal is to represent works of literature in unique ways, as well as literature that nobody else has covered.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Owen Ou, an engineer at Heroku, is joined by Tanmai Gopal, the CEO of Hasura. They start their conversation by describing what GraphQL is, and what problems it set out to solve. GraphQL focuses on making data fetching easier, whether that client is a web browser or an API call. GraphQL provides one endpoint that can query all your application&amp;#39;s domain logic. If your primary consumer of data is a front end application, then GraphQL is likely a good choice to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation continues with help on how to get started using GraphQL, and situations where GraphQL might not be useful. For example, if your data is not in JSON, or is in a binary format, it might not be a good fit. As well, depending on whether your application is a monolith or a set of microservices, how GraphQL incorporated varies, and can be difficult. Tanmai continues with his team&amp;#39;s experience of incorporating GraphQL, the challenges they faced, and the improvements they noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanmai and Owen conclude by looking to the future of GraphQL. The language is very solid, but the spec is continuing to evolve with community feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anupam Dagar is now a final-year undergraduate Computer Science student at Indian Institute of Information Technology, in Allahabad. He tells Joe Kutner, a software architect at Heroku, about how he first came across the GitHub Student Pack as a freshman. He needed a domain name, and one of his senior classmates advised him to take a look at the pack, which provides free tools for any student over the age of 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Student Developer Pack, Anupam was able to build a project called HoxNox, a portfolio generator. He noticed that a lot of his friends were spending a lot of time perfecting their resumes on paper, so he decided to create a website that took the process digital. With an urge to keep honing his skills, HoxNox was his most ambitious project to date. With companies providing hosting and emailing services through the pack, he was able to build something that became quite successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anupam strongly encourages students to not get bogged down between deciding which language or framework to make use of when starting their projects. The fundamental principles of software engineering are applicable to all of them, including catching errors and writing maintainable code. He found it useful to just start with one new part of the tech stack to work on, before mastering it and moving on to something newer. It&amp;#39;s also important to consider yourself as more than just your code. Talking to people and building a healthy community is just as important, perhaps moreso.&lt;/p&gt;

He&amp;#39;s interviewed by Julián Duque, a developer advocate at Heroku. Interview Cake offers advice on communicating your intent, tips for navigating various decisions, and computer science concepts such as data structures and algorithm efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parker explains that he was inspired to create this site after helping a friend with her programming interview over the course of a weekend. He realized that while most coding bootcamps do teach eager students how to program, they don&amp;#39;t do as well teaching soft skills, as well as more academic programming concepts. He built up his curriculum by partnering with bootcamps in San Francisco, teaching students directly, and assessing which parts of his lesson plan worked.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Host Rubert Blumen is joined by Salesforce architect Ian Varley to discuss multi-tenancy.  Their conversation covers how multi-tenancy differs from multi-user, popular architectures for multi-tenancy, why Salesforce uses a shared resource architecture, how Salesforce scales horizontally, the economics of a mix of small and large users, the importance of scaling down, scheduling, rate limiting and fairness, the threat model of a multi-tenant system, ensuring isolation between users, and technical challenges of migrating users between shards while maintaining availability and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;François Hodierne is a lead engineer at Open Collective, and he&amp;#39;s joined in conversation by Danielle Adams (the Node.js language owner at Heroku) and Becky Jaimes (the product manager for Heroku Data). Open Collective serves as a legal and banking entity for non-profit tech projects to raise donations and funds. All of Open Collective&amp;#39;s repositories are open source, and they run a complete Node.js stack, via a GraphQL API on the backend and a Next.js frontend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a core team of just three people, Open Collective relies on public contributions from its community. Recently, they&amp;#39;ve instituted a very successful bug bounty program, which uses labels to identify the amount of money an issue is worth. By assessing the difficult and urgency of an issue, they&amp;#39;ve been able to asynchronously communicate to others what they need to do and what they need to achieve to close the bug. Contributions have come in from developers all around the world, but after Open Collective&amp;#39;s recent partnership with Open Source Community Africa, the main countries they&amp;#39;ve seen activity from were Nigeria and Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Collective is hosted on Heroku, and they&amp;#39;ve found deployments by Git to be their most essential feature. They also rely on Heroku&amp;#39;s metrics dashboards, which provides just the right amount of information. François notes that his key requirement for any hosting platform or JavaScript dependency is its adoption; the more popular a technology is, the more likely it is to be understood and the easier it becomes to on-board new contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Castle, a developer advocate at Heroku, leads the discussion with Tim Specht, the co-founder and CTO of Dubsmash, a video messaging application. Tim&amp;#39;s involvement with software development stretches back over a decade, to the first evolution of smartphones, when memory management was essential and the new user experiences were being formed. It&amp;#39;s become easier now to build applications, but the expectations on quality from users has also changed. For Tim, the two journeys are intertwined: it&amp;#39;s not enough to have a depth-first approach to software development, and a baseline knowledge of how to make something computationally efficient aids programmers in building pleasing apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pivotal transition in Tim&amp;#39;s understanding of how to build great software was getting better at prioritization. Allowing others to choose strategies that work best under the circumstances allows the entire project to move forward, rather than stalling endlessly to find the most optimal solution. It&amp;#39;s important when making a technical decision to not stay committed to the path if it isn&amp;#39;t working out. Any bottleneck has two solutions: either you brute force a solution at the expense of time and productivity, or you find a solution which is good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to building a product, Tim says that it&amp;#39;s important to try and embed yourself into the news and events of your ecosystem as much as possible. Following authors on Medium or clicking through links on HackerNews not only tells you of what others are building; it also informs you of the new tools you have at your disposal. Of course, it&amp;#39;s ill-advised to jump into a new library, language, or framework, without some evaluation and caution. But community adoption for something new--that is, other companies demonstrating success--is the best signifier for whether you should incorporate it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jamie White, a front-end engineer at Heroku, is in conversation with Ben Farrell, an award-winning designer working at Adobe. Ben has just written a book about web components, a way of designing websites that&amp;#39;s been available roughly since 2013. Various polyfills and proprietary frameworks have achieved what web components is now trying to standardize: composable units of JavaScript and HTML that can be imported and reused across web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben goes over his personal experience with web components, and the history of the components themselves, starting with Polymer, which was essentially an experiment from Google. The library essentially recreated what various browser vendors wished web components would become. Eventually, the standards caught up, and now modern browsers don&amp;#39;t need as many polyfills in order to accomplish the gains web components provides to developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key strength of web components for Ben is their reusability. For prototyping a UI element, he can write a block of code once, have it imported throughout a site, and continue to make modifications to that one piece of code as needs evolve. One such example of this is the web component called Shader Doodle, which abstracts a lot of WebGL &amp;quot;messiness&amp;quot; in favor of a simple interface. He is also working with others on the idea of constructable stylesheets as a means of also importing the same CSS rules and  adopt them onto various web components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, projects like lit-HTML and lit-element will render incompatibilities between various frameworks, such as React and Angular obsolete. At their core, they will be built on web standards, which will mean easier interoperability, breaking down these barriers between them.&lt;/p&gt;

Eventually, the standards caught up, and now modern browsers don&amp;#39;t need as many polyfills in order to accomplish the gains web components provides to developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key strength of web components for Ben is their reusability. For prototyping a UI element, he can write a block of code once, have it imported throughout a site, and continue to make modifications to that one piece of code as needs evolve. One such example of this is the web component called Shader Doodle, which abstracts a lot of WebGL &amp;quot;messiness&amp;quot; in favor of a simple interface. He is also working with others on the idea of constructable stylesheets as a means of also importing the same CSS rules and  adopt them onto various web components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, projects like lit-HTML and lit-element will render incompatibilities between various frameworks, such as React and Angular obsolete. At their core, they will be built on web standards, which will mean easier interoperability, breaking down these barriers between them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leah organizes both RustConf and EmberConf, and has been organizing tech conferences for well over a decade. She talks about some of the lessons she&amp;#39;s learned in building inclusivity and accessibility into the conferences, outside of the technical talks. Childcare, for example, is one feature she&amp;#39;s introduced that has had a positive effect on both parents and children. Suddenly, workers don&amp;#39;t need to fret between networking with their peers and finding quality day care. Leah cautions that the first few years she offered this space, there weren&amp;#39;t many enrollments, primarily because attendees didn&amp;#39;t know that the option was available. But year after year, more parents are participating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ideas on gender are evolving, Leah has experimented with applying pronoun usage onto badges. At first, she made this mandatory, requiring attendees to provide their preferred pronoun while registering for the conference. She thought that this would help normalize the terminology, but she says her opinion has changed after speaking to several people. Instead, she provides pronoun stickers to attendees when they collect their badges at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some smaller opportunities, like building fitness activities into the schedule, also helps attendees maintain their routine and connect with other conference-goers in ways they might not otherwise be able to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Castle, developer advocate at Heroku, sits down with several individuals working towards making the lives of open source maintainers a little easier: Josh Simmons is the VP of the Open Source Initiative and a Senior Open Source Strategist at Salesforce; Joe Kutner works on open source programs at Heroku; and Pia Mancini, is the co-founder and CEO of Open Collective, a platform that gets funding from companies and individuals and disperses it to the open source projects they use, without those projects needing to have their own business bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues involved with financing open source projects are two-fold: first, there&amp;#39;s the challenge of actually collecting money from corporations profiting off of open source developers&amp;#39; free time; and after that, actually sorting out how to disperse these funds to contributors. Pia provides an example of the struggle of a Ukranian developer invoicing a company and receiving compensation from a U.S. bank account. Open Collective&amp;#39;s goal is to solve both of these problems, by connecting funders with projects, and handling all of the messy paperwork involved as a consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh and Joe both point out that the strategy isn&amp;#39;t just to provide a monthly donation charge, either. Funds can be allocated to support bug bounty programs, where security experts not necessarily involved in a project can participate and receive pay-outs. That&amp;#39;s necessary work that a maintainer might not necessarily think about organizing, and which definitely benefits the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Collective provides two other services within its umbrella. BackYourStack is a website which will scan the public repositories of a GitHub organization, and identifies which dependencies are part of the collective, such that companies can fairly sponsor projects they didn&amp;#39;t even know they depended on. Gift Cards is an opportunity for companies to provide gift cards to their engineers, who then in turn give those to maintainers who they acknowledge as being tremendously helpful. This places the decision making for sponsorship on the developers who most often interact with other open source developers .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The episode concludes with a foray into issues beyond financing, specifically a maintainers&amp;#39; well being. Open source isn&amp;#39;t just about creating software; you&amp;#39;ve got to also delve into issues, identify what&amp;#39;s important, have discussions, and sometimes, fend off abuse from users&amp;#39; unreasonable expectations. Josh explicitly mentions Open Sourcing Mental Illness as a resource for assisting individuals experiencing burnout. The Open Collective is also exploring ways in which to assist maintainers with tasks such as triaging issues or updating documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leah Silber is the CEO of Tilde, and she and her company have been involved in various open source projects over the years, from jQuery and Rails, to Ember and Rust. Her belief is that open source work is more than just the programming: it&amp;#39;s also corralling issues, finding the right people for the right problems, and more &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; tasks such as setting up events and conferences. Because of this, she doesn&amp;#39;t believe there&amp;#39;s a strong delineation between &amp;quot;skills for a business&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;skills for a project.&amp;quot; Allowing employees to explore new roles in projects that they love helps their skill set grow, and those skills can in turn make them better employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to this dynamic is demonstrating OSS values at work. When you treat someone&amp;#39;s contributions to projects as an essential parts of their role, there isn&amp;#39;t a direct correlation with the relationship between the company and the project. You are investing in the person and the technology, and in the long run, this will benefit the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leah also believes that it&amp;#39;s important for open source communities to not have a single point of failure by way of a single company being invested in a technology. If, for some reason, a business&amp;#39; needs shift away from a particular language or tool, the last thing anyone would want would be for an open source project to wither as a result of it. This is another reason why a company backing an open source project should be much more receptive of accepting contributions for contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, by having companies more involved in open source projects via their employees, they can direct and guide the project to satisfy their own business needs. The two entities--company and project--can discuss their needs and arrive at solutions together, rather than introducing fragmentation. What&amp;#39;s good for a company may also be good for the community, and what&amp;#39;s more, the community may have more stable and reliable implementations for any single company&amp;#39;s ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

What&amp;#39;s good for a company may also be good for the community, and what&amp;#39;s more, the community may have more stable and reliable implementations for any single company&amp;#39;s ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You couldn&amp;#39;t find a more perfect pair of guests to talk about Rust than Carol Nichols and Jake Goulding. Carol and Jake write books that teach Rust, maintain websites that allow users to run Rust samples, record videos about Rust, and also manage the Rust Belt Rust conference, where Rust developers congregate in the Rust Belt region of America. Carol has a background in Ruby, and always sought to eke out more performance and less memory consumption. Jake has a background in C, but recognizes that it places a heavy burden on a programmer to be mindful of memory leaks and segmentation faults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust is a fantastic programming language from Mozilla. It has a much simpler and intuitive syntax than C, the compiler is optimized to ensure that you are writing memory-safe code, and as a result, it produces executables that run much more quickly (and require less resource consumption) than a dynamic language like Ruby. Carol and Jake delve into how the Rust compiler does this, primarily by aggressively freeing memory and forbidding developers from interactions with dereferenced objects. To newcomers, Rust seems like a forboding language, but Carol and Jake believe that Rust&amp;#39;s emphasis on terrific documentation and error messages help guide newbies and veterans alike into writing safer and faster code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several large companies see the benefits of Rust and are writing it in production, such as Mozilla, Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Heroku even has an unofficial buildpack for serving Rust applications, and Carol notes that in one of her projects she&amp;#39;s paying more for log storage than for dyno consumption, due to how efficiently Rust uses memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust has an ecosystem-first approach to language design (rather than placing everything into the standard library), which has fostered a largely collaborative open source community. Carol and Jake advise, however, that the language is still evolving, and they don&amp;#39;t recommend rewriting all your functional business logic into Rust just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two conclude by providing many resources on getting started with Rust in the form of books, videos, and coding challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Many resources for learning Rust were mentioned in this episode:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For books, you can get started by reading &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/"&gt;The Rust Programming Language Book&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920040385.do"&gt;Programming Rust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For hands-on coding examples, &lt;a href="https://play.integer32.com/"&gt;the Rust Playground&lt;/a&gt; allows you to run snippets of Rust code; &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/"&gt;Rust by Example&lt;/a&gt; shows common programming problems solved through Rust implementations; &lt;a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/intro.html"&gt;the Rust Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; offers slightly longer code samples; and both &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings"&gt;Rustlings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://exercism.io/tracks/rust"&gt;Excercism.io&lt;/a&gt; have interactive tutorials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.manning.com/livevideo/rust-in-motion"&gt;Rust in Motion&lt;/a&gt; is a video series Carol and Jake are producing to introduce developers to Rust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.rust-belt-rust.com/"&gt;Rust Belt Rust conference&lt;/a&gt; is where Rust developers and enthusiasts from around the world will gather to discuss production Rust usage, best practices, and what’s next for Rust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://crates.io/"&gt;crates.io&lt;/a&gt; is where Rust packages reside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rust is in production at &lt;a href="https://research.mozilla.org/rust/"&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://fuchsia.dev/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aaron Schlesinger is the core maintainer on Athens, an open source on-prem module proxy. He walks through the history of packages and modules in Go, and introduces how Athens satisfies the needs of developers. Go modules allow you to serve up a Go project&amp;#39;s dependencies via an API; Athens implements that API--and integrates with other implementations of the API as well--to simplify dependency management, no matter where the code is stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyang Liu is the CTO and co-founder of Sourcegraph, a company that focuses on developer tools. They use Go to build high-performance code search, code intelligence, and jump to def functionality that works across repository boundaries and across entire code bases. Their role at GopherCon 2019 is to live blog all of the talks for interested parties who were not able to physically attend the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liz Rice is a technology evangelist with Aqua Security. It&amp;#39;s a container security company, and she came to GopherCon to teach a workshop that introduced people to the concepts behind containers. She also recently became a Google developer expert in Go, which certifies her as someone creating interesting content that the community can look towards for education and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny Boursiquot is an SRE at Heroku, and a long time gopher. He gave the closing keynote at GopherCon, and his singular focus is on ensuring that the Go community is truly diverse and welcoming to new members. Every year, new developers attend GopherCon, and he wants to encourage veterans to embrace this growth as a positive change. He also provides a wealth of resources on listeners who are brand new to Go and eager to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Castle recently attended GopherCon 2019 in San Diego, and captured small conversations from many different Go community members. In Part One of a two-part episode, he had several conversations with GopherCon speakers about what they were building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Gerakines is the Director of Software Engineering at Mattel, the toy company. Mattel has several toys with Internet connectivity, and Go is the primary language used for all of their connected products, whether it&amp;#39;s to support authentication and parental controls, or  providing product catalog and product instance information. A lot of core gameplay mechanics, such as the number of &amp;quot;miles&amp;quot; a car has ridden on a track, are also transmitted and reported through Go services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Ross works at FireHydrant. They&amp;#39;re using Go for their Kubernetes integration and internal developer tools for local development. For example, they are able to build Docker Compose files on the fly. His favorite aspect about the language is that it can build a portable (and performant!) binary with very few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica Lucci is an infrastructure engineer at GitHub. Her interest in Go is catered towards establishing some standardizations beyond simple code formatting. For example, with the recent introduction of Go modules, devising a system around versioning third-party libraries is an interesting problem, particularly when it comes to pinning versions for consistency or updating versions in the event of a CVE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Raymond works for Gopher Guides, and conducted a training session on testing your Go code. His favorite aspect of GopherCon is its community, where new and old friends meet to share their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Chris Castle recently attended GopherCon 2019 in San Diego, and captured small conversations from many different Go community members. In Part One of a two-part episode, he had several conversations with GopherCon speakers about what they were building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Gerakines is the Director of Software Engineering at Mattel, the toy company. Mattel has several toys with Internet connectivity, and Go is the primary language used for all of their connected products, whether it&amp;#39;s to support authentication and parental controls, or  providing product catalog and product instance information. A lot of core gameplay mechanics, such as the number of &amp;quot;miles&amp;quot; a car has ridden on a track, are also transmitted and reported through Go services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Ross works at FireHydrant. They&amp;#39;re using Go for their Kubernetes integration and internal developer tools for local development. For example, they are able to build Docker Compose files on the fly. His favorite aspect about the language is that it can build a portable (and performant!) binary with very few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica Lucci is an infrastructure engineer at GitHub. Her interest in Go is catered towards establishing some standardizations beyond simple code formatting. For example, with the recent introduction of Go modules, devising a system around versioning third-party libraries is an interesting problem, particularly when it comes to pinning versions for consistency or updating versions in the event of a CVE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Raymond works for Gopher Guides, and conducted a training session on testing your Go code. His favorite aspect of GopherCon is its community, where new and old friends meet to share their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Joe Kutner, an engineer at Heroku, leads the discussion on Cloud Native Buildpacks with Stephen Levine (engineer at Pivotal), Emily Casey (engineer at Pivotal), Ben Hale (steward of the Java Buildpack), and Terence Lee (engineer at Heroku). All of them are involved in overseeing the CNB project, and have used the technology in production at their companies. At its core, CNBs are an OCI-compliant alternative to Dockerfiles, except the container is built without very much developer interaction. By analyzing source code, CNB is able to determine the base image to start from, as well as which steps to undertake in order to ensure that an application runs correctly. It&amp;#39;s a similar logical process to the way in which Heroku&amp;#39;s regular buildpacks operate: one Git push command is all that Heroku needs to generate a slug of your application, including fetching any dependencies or managing assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Buildpack provides you with consistency by keeping your dependencies and base image up-to-date to the latest standards. It also doesn&amp;#39;t require the average application developer to also be an expert on everything. Rather than needing to understand all of the Unix-y commands necessary to compose an application, or knowing when a particular component has a CVE, a developer&amp;#39;s chief concern concern is to continue building their app as usual, and CNB will handle all of the other components necessary to make a deployable container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim for CNBs was to make development easier for individual developers, as well as those at large enterprises. Terrance and Ben in particular know that the value of the buildpacks come from five years of production experience. Regular applications have benefitted from buildpacks, and the ecosystem around those had grown to the point where they could take what they&amp;#39;d learned and apply them to container images as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The episode concludes with a look towards the future of CNBs. As all of the APIs and tooling are open source, groups can also design CNBs for any language and framework they wish to containerize. The project recently entered beta, and, despite the positive reaction, there are still some changes that need to be made with regards to how changes to buildpacks are applied. There are processes for community members to be involved, and multiple forums for communicating with the CNB leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of its product suite to automate a business&amp;#39; needs, Salesforce offers a Live Agent product, whose central component is a chatbot that can respond to a user&amp;#39;s inquiries on the web or other messaging platforms, such as Facebook or SMS. A key design requirement of the chatbot is to be able to simulate human interaction by responding quickly. For an engineering team of eight, that means being able to offload as much operational responsibility as possible to Heroku&amp;#39;s platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&amp;#39;s customers exist around the world, from Europe to Asia to the Americas. Heroku provide multiregional offerings for its dynos and databases that don&amp;#39;t require too much administration or configuration. The benefits of not needing to define roles or specifications further simplifies the chatbot team&amp;#39;s own architectural decision to design it as a collection of microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the chatbot team uses Terraform to define the infrastructure requirements of their application. By predefining the necessary add-ons, data services, and private spaces for every application, they are able to quickly spin up new external services whenever necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cory Haber is the VP of Technology for Furnished Quarters, a global corporate housing company. But he&amp;#39;s also an educated painter. He&amp;#39;s interviewed by Erin Allard, a Platform Support Engineer at Heroku, to delve into the effect technology has had on art, and vice versa. For Cory, art is about the intent of the artist; it&amp;#39;s a moot point to ask whether anything a computer produces can be considered art. In the end, a human has trained an AI or written the software, and the computer becomes a tool, similar to a camera or a pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engaging in artist practices allows Cory to take a break from the purely logical examinations which programming requires of him. To some, it may be seen as procrastination, but he believes that the best way to solve a problem is to allow your mind to wander of. That&amp;#39;s what his current painting practices allows him to do. At the same time, he also follows along on the generative art movement, which takes place primarily on Twitter. There, artists and programmers share their programs that generate art that can be represented on screens or canvases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of generative art goes back to the 60s. For individuals curious to learn more about this practice, he recommends the Processing programming language. Similar to a Jupyter notebook, it&amp;#39;s a part-framework, part-application hybrid that works in generating visual arts. He also encourages individuals with no artistic background to just start taking classes on painting or music. No one knows everything about programming when they first start; they learn the skill and become better at it the more time they invest. Art is created under a similar focus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trey starts the conversation with Shirley by noting the difference between being a manager and being a leader. Managers are a framework for discussing pay, onboarding and offboarding, HR interactions, and so forth. Leadership is about inspiring others to unite together to work behind a purpose. Any IC, for example, can be a leader for just a handful of his teammates. Being a good leader means knowing what&amp;#39;s important, conveying that to someone else, and executing on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that, Trey emphasizes that a foundation of psychological safety is essential. Allowing people to speak up when they disagree with an issue, or admitting your faults when you&amp;#39;ve made a mistake, is an incredible method of breaking down barriers between people and fostering a culture of truth. Fostering individual growth is also a good strategy, as people generally want to continue improving, whether it&amp;#39;s learning a new programming language or a new technical system they&amp;#39;re curious about. Removing obstacles to people achieving their goals is key as a leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shirley notes that the role of a leader requires an immense amount of mental and emotional energy, as your concerns are not just your own, but also those of the people who rely on you. Trey responds by emphasizing health as an important priority that&amp;#39;s often neglected. Individuals will take better care of their pets than themselves. By demonstrating that he is not infallible, by taking vacations, encouraging exercise, or ensuring enough hours of sleep, his team in response understands that taking breaks is a good decision, not a dangerous one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, communication is always necessary. If there are too many distractions that prevent you from accomplishing an objective, you should tell your team you&amp;#39;ll need some quiet time, rather than silently disappear. If you&amp;#39;re concerned about a path a company is embarking on, you should tell a leader you feel comfortable talking with. Communication breeds trust, and that&amp;#39;s the foundation of any successful relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="links-from-this-episode"&gt;Links from this episode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trey recommends several books on effective leadership:&lt;/p&gt;

      <googleplay:description>&lt;p&gt;Trey starts the conversation with Shirley by noting the difference between being a manager and being a leader. Managers are a framework for discussing pay, onboarding and offboarding, HR interactions, and so forth. Leadership is about inspiring others to unite together to work behind a purpose. Any IC, for example, can be a leader for just a handful of his teammates. Being a good leader means knowing what&amp;#39;s important, conveying that to someone else, and executing on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that, Trey emphasizes that a foundation of psychological safety is essential. Allowing people to speak up when they disagree with an issue, or admitting your faults when you&amp;#39;ve made a mistake, is an incredible method of breaking down barriers between people and fostering a culture of truth. Fostering individual growth is also a good strategy, as people generally want to continue improving, whether it&amp;#39;s learning a new programming language or a new technical system they&amp;#39;re curious about. Removing obstacles to people achieving their goals is key as a leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shirley notes that the role of a leader requires an immense amount of mental and emotional energy, as your concerns are not just your own, but also those of the people who rely on you. Trey responds by emphasizing health as an important priority that&amp;#39;s often neglected. Individuals will take better care of their pets than themselves. By demonstrating that he is not infallible, by taking vacations, encouraging exercise, or ensuring enough hours of sleep, his team in response understands that taking breaks is a good decision, not a dangerous one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, communication is always necessary. If there are too many distractions that prevent you from accomplishing an objective, you should tell your team you&amp;#39;ll need some quiet time, rather than silently disappear. If you&amp;#39;re concerned about a path a company is embarking on, you should tell a leader you feel comfortable talking with. Communication breeds trust, and that&amp;#39;s the foundation of any successful relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trey recommends several books on effective leadership:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Design is at the very core of Heroku, influencing every aspect of the brand and the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join Vikram Rana, product marketing and developer advocacy lead at Heroku, as he chats with Heroku’s head of brand design and front-end developer Charlie Gleason on his role—covering his history and background, what it’s like to work at Heroku, and how he handles being a custodian for a brand he loves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From tooling, to teamwork, to the ethos of the brand itself, Charlie and Vik dig into what makes good design (and more importantly) what makes design good. They cover topics like ethics, empathy, humility, education, and bringing your authentic self to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also, one correction—The Cut is based in Perth, not Melbourne. Sorry, Scott.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getaway is a startup that offers short-term rentals. They specialize in ensuring that the domiciles they offer are far outside city limits and often inaccessible to Internet and cellular connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://heroku-www-files.s3.amazonaws.com//uploads/71188dc5-13c6-44b0-a9e2-eee3f65a629c/Boston%20Outpost%2C%20Summer%202018.jpg" alt="Boston Outpost, Summer 2018"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach Feldman, their VP of Technology, chats with Jason Salaz, a member of the Heroku Support Team, about the unique challenges this requirement imposes. For example, rather than providing a physical key, guests can unlock their cabin door&amp;#39;s smart lock with a unique pin code.  In order to support their efforts to scale, a custom API was built to ensure that pin codes are registered and deactivated for every check-in and check-out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://heroku-www-files.s3.amazonaws.com//uploads/0844496a-169d-487d-8e6c-573ec36a4e58/3-getaway_smart_dashboard_status_received.png" alt="3-getaway_smart_dashboard_status_received"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cabins are also equipped with other IoT automation devices, such as leak sensors, which report back to Getaway House if pipes are leaking. Both of these technologies were designed to work on the low latency connections that the cabins are equipped with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relying on SMS is another way that the team is able to provide service, as those networks predate much of the current infrastructure that smartphones have come to rely on. Building correct and functional software is difficult, but Zach notes that there&amp;#39;s an even greater challenge in scaling fault-tolerant systems in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heroku Front-end Engineer Jamie White sits down with René Winkelmeyer, a developer evangelist at Salesforce, to talk about the company&amp;#39;s commitment to advancing web components. Web components are a collection of standardized web and browser APIs designed to overcome some of the limitations with the design of the Internet, particularly when it comes to page rendering. Web components exist outside of web frameworks such as React, Ember, or Vue in that they are built using standard web technologies and can be used in any application, regardless of the framework or language it&amp;#39;s architected in. They&amp;#39;re built for reusability and consistency across your application&amp;#39;s UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightning Web Components is a toolkit built and open sourced by Salesforce to ease the development of web components. These components are Enterprise-level, in that they provide functionality for many complicated UI scenarios.

      <itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Heroku Front-end Engineer Jamie White sits down with René Winkelmeyer, a developer evangelist at Salesforce, to talk about the company&amp;#39;s commitment to advancing web components. Web components are a collection of standardized web and browser APIs designed to overcome some of the limitations with the design of the Internet, particularly when it comes to page rendering. Web components exist outside of web frameworks such as React, Ember, or Vue in that they are built using standard web technologies and can be used in any application, regardless of the framework or language it&amp;#39;s architected in. They&amp;#39;re built for reusability and consistency across your application&amp;#39;s UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightning Web Components is a toolkit built and open sourced by Salesforce to ease the development of web components. These components are Enterprise-level, in that they provide functionality for many complicated UI scenarios.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web started off weird, and there’s a wonderful and concerted effort to ensure that, at least parts of it, stay that way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku designer Charlie Gleason and lead strategist Stephen Barlow dive into their experiences working on side projects—small, silly, funny, and emotive vignettes on the web—that span random &lt;a href="https://thiskindofagility.superhighfives.com/"&gt;Arrested Development episode selectors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.kanyezone.com/"&gt;Kanye West browser-based mini games&lt;/a&gt;, collaborative art projects, and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn how to get involved with your own community of makers, why it’s more important to have fun than it is to try and get internet famous, and some things to look out for when working with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, put away the kanban board, get inspired, and keep the internet weird with a side project of your own.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Castle continues his conversation with Claire Lee, the head of the early stage group at Silicon Valley Bank. In this half, Claire begins by providing hard data that indicates companies which are founded by individuals from diverse backgrounds are wildly profitable. She goes on to say that conversely, the members in the top VCs firms are of a disproportionate make-up. She concludes that in order for more funds and ancillary services to be available to start-up founders, the individuals distributing the capital also needs to change, in order to give everyone a fair shot at success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claire goes on to point out that in addition to money, mentorship is a valuable (and limited) resource in Silicon Valley. A good partnership with a VC includes them granting access to advisors, potential board members, and potential customers. Her passion extends beyond just funding good ideas; it&amp;#39;s about making connections between people and helping them to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The episode concludes with advice and encouragement for anyone interested in founding a start-up. If you feel that you can solve a problem in ways that no one else has before, that passion will manifest itself into an opportunity in one way or another, whether that&amp;#39;s within a start-up accelerator or in a digital community. Surround yourself with people who believe in you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Castle sits down with Claire Lee, the head of the early stage group at Silicon Valley Bank. Claire discusses the various startups she is involved with across various sectors, such as cleantech, fintech, and healthcare. Much of the conversation revolves around her experience at Recode&amp;#39;s Code Conference 2019 and three lessons she took away from her attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, media platform companies such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter need to make large changes to become more transparent. Their user base is losing trust due to the persistent problems of hostile environments, hate speech, and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second takeaway was on the role of technology throughout our lives. For example, automated content moderation through AI can only go so far, as the technology behind them require a certain baseline standard of ethics which is as yet to be defined. A generation of new users are looking for tooling to place constraints on bad actors, which are problems that have not been tackled at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Claire&amp;#39;s third realization was the adaptation of technology in decidedly non-startup environs. For example, she cites how both Harley Davidson and Goldman Sachs are revolutionizing their businesses to adapt to both new consumer needs and to attract engineering talent. Both consumers and employees are demanding better corporate values before acquiring or working for a brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Claire&amp;#39;s third realization was the adaptation of technology in decidedly non-startup environs. For example, she cites how both Harley Davidson and Goldman Sachs are revolutionizing their businesses to adapt to both new consumer needs and to attract engineering talent. Both consumers and employees are demanding better corporate values before acquiring or working for a brand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matte Noble is a Senior Software Engineer at Sentry, an application with the capability to stitch together different developer tools through their APIs. For example, an exception that occurs in your application can be automatically represented as an item in your project management tool&amp;#39;s backlog. On top of this, Sentry provides a platform for tools to also integrate with. Matte identifies his past work experiences as leading him to conclude that when building an application like this, it&amp;#39;s important to consider your two types of users as having distinct concerns: one group is content with using the product as-is, and another group is the set of developers who are building tooling and integrations for that first group. By intentionally building your product as a set of APIs that communicate with various systems, you simultaneously build features your users want that your integrators can build on top of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to design a good interface, Matte says that it&amp;#39;s important to keep the responses concise, in order to avoid blurring the lines between individual resources and their responsibilities. In order to translate your internal understanding of your product&amp;#39;s primitives into something consumable, it&amp;#39;s important to listen to your customers and ask what their needs are, before simply exposing an API that is hard to change once it&amp;#39;s public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sentry&amp;#39;s primary technical challenges are surfaced in one of two ways. First, there&amp;#39;s an issue of consistency, in that if two services are being connected, and one of them fails for some reason, Sentry is responsible for reacting to that, even if the external service did not provide any indication that something went wrong. Second, while Sentry is sufficient at handling large volumes of data, the same might not be true of a service they are pushing data to.  In order to make Sentry scalable, it&amp;#39;s not just a matter of working with their own engineering and product teams: they must also be mindful of third-parties over which they have no control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The episode concludes with Matte&amp;#39;s advice for any organizations interested in offering an add-on marketplace. For him, it&amp;#39;s about providing capabilities that make the integrator &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to integrate with your platform. For example, if billing is a component of the marketplace, it&amp;#39;s important to build tools and features that allow an integrator to understand the revenue that they&amp;#39;re making from your ecosystem. It&amp;#39;s also important to focus on request/response times and errors rates, so that you can have the confidence in the health of those integrations and fix potential issues as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Castle sits down with Shirley Xu, who went through a coding bootcamp, and Eric Chen, who is a recent graduate, to talk about their journey into their first programming jobs at Heroku. For both of them, the experience of programming in a day-to-day role is vastly different than what they experienced at school; namely, rather than analyzing algorithms, they were exposed to Ruby, Rails, and entire groups of people involved in shipping features. They recognize that they went through a period experiencing imposter syndrome, before realizing that every developer, no matter their status, shares those same feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain soft skills were also acquired. Eric learned how to move past his fear of looking ignorant and just ask questions whenever he didn&amp;#39;t know a term or a process. He felt that this made him into a better engineer and, besides which, no one had ever refused to explain a concept. Shirley discovered that in order for her to achieve her goals, she needed to express them clearly to her mentors and manager. For example, after she expressed that she would one day like to become a technical lead or manager, her mentor was better able to develop a long term plan of the concrete steps that Shirley would need to take to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech moves fast, and a portion of this episode is dedicated to how everyone keeps up with the latest trends and terms. All agree that the breadth of knowledge is simply too much to consume, and it&amp;#39;s okay to not know everything. That doesn&amp;#39;t make you a better or worse developer: it simply means your expertise lies elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The episode concludes with some advice for anyone not in software development, but is considering a change. Eric suggests keeping yourself motivated, with time blocks in your schedule dedicated to simply learning. Shirley provides a long list of resources, as well as a six-to-twelve month timeframe to go from a neophyte to your first job.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Josh Aas, the co-founder of the non-profit Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), is interviewed by Craig Ingram, a Runtime Engineer at Heroku. Amongst other outreach programs, ISRG is in charge of developing Let&amp;#39;s Encrypt, which is a Certificate Authority (CA) designed to provide free TLS/SSL certificates to any website on the web. While starting ISRG in 2013, Josh noted that only about a third of websites on the Internet were secured by HTTPS. He discovered that not only was the price of acquiring a certificate a barrier to entry, but the technical requirements to apply a certificate was also cumbersome. Let&amp;#39;s Encrypt began as a way to simplify the application of aTLS/SSL certificate for any website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founding a CA was no easy task. To begin with, a brand new CA is &amp;quot;untrusted,&amp;quot; and it takes up to a decade for every company and Internet-ready device in the world to accept your validity. In 2015, Let&amp;#39;s Encrypt partnered with another CA called IdenTrust by having them cross-sign certificates. This allows Let’s Encrypt to operate and provide certs while making progress towards becoming a fully independent CA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, there have been several trade-offs between Let&amp;#39;s Encrypt original goals and features that users have requested. Although ISRG would like to limit the technical scope of what Let&amp;#39;s Encrypt offers to keep the process simple, they have worked through feedback to ensure that they meet a majority of their users&amp;#39; needs. Although HTTPS certainly helps secure communication between a user and a website, there are still more layers of the Internet which require protection. One of these is called Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijacking. The team is working on mitigations to make these sorts of attacks impractical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="links-from-this-episode"&gt;Links from this episode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol"&gt;Border Gateway Protocol&lt;/a&gt; is, in Josh&amp;#39;s opinion, another major component of the Internet which requires stronger security.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tyler Montgomery, Trailhead&amp;#39;s engineering director, and Shaun Russell, its principal engineer, kick off a conversation with Chris Castle as to how Trailhead came about. One of Salesforce&amp;#39;s developer evangelists, Josh Burke, wanted to create some teaching material for classes he taught. The idea was that students wouldn&amp;#39;t just read some content and take a quiz; they would perform real actions, such as making a dummy user an admin, and an API call would assert that they accomplished the task successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to its tight deadline of just six weeks before Dreamforce, the Trailhead team built the app using Ruby and Rails, and hosted the site on Heroku. Although they&amp;#39;ve seen huge growth, a lot of naive technical decisions have lead to a mix of addressing performance issues as well as launching new features over the past few years. Their largest near-outage came about when hundreds of thousands of students in India began to use the site all at the same time in order to participate in a competition. Heroku was able to scale up, but this exposed many problems which, when the traffic subsided, better prepared the Trailhead team for future scaling issues after all the code fixes were in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation concludes with advice on scaling up an application on Heroku. Shaun suggests an APM tool like New Relic to stay on top of performance problems before they become an issue. Tyler suggests implementing an entire pipeline of tooling--PagerDuty, errors logged into Slack, segmented environments for staging and production--before continuing work on any feature code.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Terraform is an open source project to help automate the provisioning of infrastructure resources and services for your application. It integrates with cloud platforms through open source plugins, called providers. Mars Hall is a Heroku engineer that works on the Heroku provider. Rather than using a CLI or a web UI, Terraform provides a platform-agnostic configuration file written in the Hashicorp Configuration Language, or HCL. This sets Terraform apart from similar tools like Chef, which relies on Ruby, or Ansible, which only relies on provisioning server state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation veers towards the architecture of a provider and how individuals can contribute to the Heroku provider integration. Essentially, a platform exposes some HTTP endpoints that a provider than communicates with. This means that while open source community can contribute to a provider, there are some feature requests which are dependent on the platform exposing accessibility first. Mars suggests that individuals first open an issue with their request, and a Heroku engineer will convey whether that&amp;#39;s on the roadmap or free to accept pull requests. Although HCL is easy to learn, all of the providers—and Terraform itself—is written in Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some best practices are provided for larger organizations interested in working with Terraform on Heroku. Among these include strict guidelines for always using Terraform to manage an app&amp;#39;s configuration; using consistent naming schemes to indicate that an app is managed by Terraform; and relying on provisioner health checks to help guide Terraform&amp;#39;s automation steps. The episode ends with a look forward at the next release of both Terraform and Heroku&amp;#39;s provider plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Léonie Watson does many things: she worked on overhauling the UK government&amp;#39;s digital services, is on the W3C advisory board, acts as co-chair of the W3C web platform working group, is an advisor for Google&amp;#39;s Accelerated Mobile Pages project, and also runs the Inclusive Design 24 conference. She also happens to be visually impaired. The show begins with how she went from drama school towards a career as a web programmer, and how she become a strong advocate for improving accessibility in web standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Léonie stresses that anyone can get involved in the decisions that power the web by contributing to the W3C&amp;#39;s public conversations at GitHub. She details the lifecycle of a proposal, and highlights how considerations such as accessibility, security, and privacy are built-in. While existing standards are well-conceived for realms such as SVG, HTML, or ARIA, there are still new frontiers to work towards every year, particularly with API-driven interfaces. Léonie mentions how the interfaces for the &amp;quot;Internet of things&amp;quot; still need to make progress to ensure those devices are usable by all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several tools to help software developers build more accessible systems. Chrome&amp;#39;s Dev Tools, for example, have a suite of checks you can run on a website to grade its accessibility. Platforms such as Axe or Tenon can run automated tests as part of a CI flow to maintain high quality code before it ships. For Léonie, it&amp;#39;s important for designers, developers, and product managers not to be overwhelmed by all the requirements and allow perfect to be the enemy of good. Even attempting inclusive design advances technology towards a much better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation continues with some discussion on Léonie&amp;#39;s work with TetraLogical, a consultancy focused on accessibility in emerging technologies, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and WebXR. By setting a standard for inclusive design principles, Léonie hopes that organizations can incorporate accessibility as yet another aspect of good design, beyond just the bare minimums required by tech specs and test suites.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Designer and front end developer Charlie Gleason and developer David Routen are both on Heroku&amp;#39;s marketing team, and both of them transitioned into the world of programming from disparate career paths. For them, moving into tech was about following their passion for creative problem solving. They did so by first creating a plan for what they needed to learn. After viewing several job postings, they got a sense of what skills each potential employer required, and then set about to learn them. Fundamentally, they believe that a strong grasp of the building blocks of the web, like HTML and CSS, plus at least one other higher level language (JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python), is a great way to get started. There are many free resources to learn programming on the web, but there are also more structured courses which you can pay for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to practice those skills, they recommend speaking to members of your community who need basic web work done, and asking if you can volunteer there in exchange for putting the work in your portfolio or CV. This will show potential employers an idea of who you are and what you&amp;#39;re capable of. Even if programming isn&amp;#39;t your thing, there are loads of other roles as well, such as data scientists, project management, or software quality assurance. As well, following people in the industry—either through their blog, Twitter, or local meetups—is a great way to network and hear about additional opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Designer and front end developer Charlie Gleason and developer David Routen are both on Heroku&amp;#39;s marketing team, and both of them transitioned into the world of programming from disparate career paths. For them, moving into tech was about following their passion for creative problem solving. They did so by first creating a plan for what they needed to learn. After viewing several job postings, they got a sense of what skills each potential employer required, and then set about to learn them. Fundamentally, they believe that a strong grasp of the building blocks of the web, like HTML and CSS, plus at least one other higher level language (JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python), is a great way to get started. There are many free resources to learn programming on the web, but there are also more structured courses which you can pay for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to practice those skills, they recommend speaking to members of your community who need basic web work done, and asking if you can volunteer there in exchange for putting the work in your portfolio or CV. This will show potential employers an idea of who you are and what you&amp;#39;re capable of. Even if programming isn&amp;#39;t your thing, there are loads of other roles as well, such as data scientists, project management, or software quality assurance. As well, following people in the industry—either through their blog, Twitter, or local meetups—is a great way to network and hear about additional opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This episode begins with a roundtable introduction from five Herokai engineers who describe what motiviated them to speak at their first conference. If you&amp;#39;re a first-time speaker, it&amp;#39;s best to let conference organizers be aware of this, not only because they will support you, but also because they will try to give you a prime time slot in order to boost your message (and spirits).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group then delves into how to prepare and practice for your talk. In general, they agree that improvising is not a good idea, unless you&amp;#39;re absolutely an expert in the subject matter. You should also be able to account for the lack of Internet access, which means that live coding is also not recommended. Every speaker is nervous, no matter how many talks they give, but everyone in the room wants you to succeed, and doesn&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve skipped a specific sentence or word. It&amp;#39;s best to just roll with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of deciding the subject matter, some of the engineers pick two or three variations on a single topic, and try to submit each flavor to as many conferences as they can. Another strategy is to hone one really unique angle--or even choose a subject matter that is so &amp;quot;common&amp;quot; to a developer&amp;#39;s day-to-day routine they don&amp;#39;t think about it. Those sorts of talks get people to really engage in something they may have never realized before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation concludes with ways to get better at public speaking, whether that&amp;#39;s rewatching your recorded self and noticing your body language, or simply giving the same talk at another conference, and building on what works.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For many years, Jeff Dickey was a lead architect for Heroku&amp;#39;s CLI tool, which was used by application developers to get their apps deployed to Heroku&amp;#39;s platform. He muses on his history with CLIs with Nahid Samsami, a director of product at Heroku, as the two of them worked together on oclif.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oclif was designed from the start to be a framework for developers to use when building their own command-line interfaces. It&amp;#39;s currently written in TypeScript, but Jeff goes through its four-year history, starting with its roots in Ruby and on thorough its Frankenstein&amp;#39;s monster mashup of Go and JavaScript. While each language had its pros and cons, the key constraint was how the resulting command-line binary program would be distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project has been incredibly popular, both through internal adoption at Heroku and Salesforce, to its reception and use from other companies, as well as the active contributions made on GitHub. The episode concludes with some theories about the future of CLI tooling. PowerShell, for example, is a fully object-oriented environment which a developer can program against. Jeff is also interested in better integration between the terminal and UI elements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Francis Lacoste, a Director of Engineering at Heroku, is a longtime meditation practitioner. In 2015, he attended public seminar on mindfulness by the Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute, which was co-founded by a former Google engineer. The workshop emphasized mindfulness as a benefit to businesses by framing the mental health benefits as something that could improve worker productivity. Enlightened by this discovery, he worked to bring the lessons over to Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku&amp;#39;s remote culture introduced some challenges to the original structure of the program. Participants are connected through Zoom meetings, rather than being seated in a room together. As well, the workshop take place over the course of a week, rather than two very long days. Herokai have responded very positively to the lessons, and some have earnestly applied the practices at home and with their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual practice itself is very secularized, even though it draws on Buddhist traditions. Francis Lacoste believes that culturally, we are not given the appropriate tooling to deal with conflicts and stress, and finds mindfulness to be a fantastic aid to those problems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the explosive growth of people using, and contributing to, open source projects over the last decade, more and more of us are spending their time reading, writing, and understanding documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/"&gt;Dev Center&lt;/a&gt; is the central hub of documentation for Heroku, covering everything from  &lt;a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/start"&gt;getting started&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/how-heroku-works"&gt;how Heroku works&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/extending-heroku"&gt;extending the platform&lt;/a&gt;. It acts as a manual for the entire platform, spanning an enormous number of topics and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Barlow, lead strategist for Dev Center, joins Heroku designer / developer Charlie Gleason to discuss why good documentation is so important—from some of the common challenges you and your team might face while writing them, to advice for rationalising and improving your documentation workflow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tune in to learn why good docs aren&amp;#39;t just good—they&amp;#39;re great.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vaidehi Joshi found that many resources on the web about core computer science concepts she wanted to know more about were either too obtuse or too academic. She started a blog, basecs, where she wrote down something she had learned that week--every week--for an entire year. While learning something new in and of itself was a delight, her curiosity led her to question how people learn best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She discusses the Feynman Technique, which, through a processes of iteratively explaining a concept to someone who doesn&amp;#39;t know anything about it, strengthens the knowledge for both the student and the teacher. The best way to do this is by telling a narrative. It keeps the listener engaged, while also serving as a way of identifying gaps in ones&amp;#39; own understanding, as new questions arise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heroku splits its units of work into squads; on this episode, we&amp;#39;re joined by some members of the squad responsible for the Private Spaces feature. Every member of the squad is remote from one another. The team talks about the pain points around this setup, and the solutions they&amp;#39;ve set up to minimize feelings of isolation. One tactic has been to keep a long-running meeting URL. Individuals from around the team can hop in and enter a space where they can just be social with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each teammate also explains why they joined Heroku, and what they appreciate about a company that values remote work. They conclude with a discussion on their favorite programming languages and editors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Castle introduces Becky Jaimes, the product manager for Heroku Dataclips. Dataclips is a feature that allows you to save and version SQL queries against a Postgres database. You can export these queries to JSON or CSV, share them online, or simply access them through an HTTP API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two discuss the history of Dataclips, namely what its original needs were and how it has evolved. It was originally targeted towards individuals who simply wanted a quick way to get access to rows from a database, and now it&amp;#39;s grown to be a useful source of information for BizOps teams, engineers, and product managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newest release of Dataclips came out of a very long beta program involving customers of various sizes. Some customers had a few dozen queries they accessed frequently, while others had thousands of them. The team at Heroku wanted to create a one-size-fits-all solution, while at the same time reducing technical debt which had been a hinderance to shipping quickly. Becky shares some of the features that are now available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://www0.assets.heroku.com/podcasts/codeish/Codeish_episode_7_SHIFT_Commerce_Ryan_Townsend.mp3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Castle introduces Ryan Townsend, CTO of Shift Commerce, and the two begin by discussing the absolutely abysmal performance of web sites in areas with bad latency: airplanes, the rural countryside, or even just within a crowded cafe or conference. Shift Commerce provides a customizable shopping platform for its customers, who are several big brand retailers. For them, every millisecond of delay means lost revenue, as studies have shown that customers are unlikely to complete their purchase if it takes too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important for Shift Commerce to stay hyper-tuned into its performance. Since it&amp;#39;s a multi-tenant application, they have several safeguards in place to ensure that one customer&amp;#39;s traffic spike doesn&amp;#39;t affect any other retailers. One such strategy is to lean into several of Heroku&amp;#39;s features, such as its API, to do some of the heavier lifting. They&amp;#39;re perfectly contently to let Heroku manage the operations work while they focus on the application itself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Chris Castle introduces Ryan Townsend, CTO of Shift Commerce, and the two begin by discussing the absolutely abysmal performance of web sites in areas with bad latency: airplanes, the rural countryside, or even just within a crowded cafe or conference. Shift Commerce provides a customizable shopping platform for its customers, who are several big brand retailers. For them, every millisecond of delay means lost revenue, as studies have shown that customers are unlikely to complete their purchase if it takes too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important for Shift Commerce to stay hyper-tuned into its performance. Since it&amp;#39;s a multi-tenant application, they have several safeguards in place to ensure that one customer&amp;#39;s traffic spike doesn&amp;#39;t affect any other retailers. One such strategy is to lean into several of Heroku&amp;#39;s features, such as its API, to do some of the heavier lifting. They&amp;#39;re perfectly contently to let Heroku manage the operations work while they focus on the application itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to increased traffic, although there are &amp;quot;quick wins&amp;quot; by increasing the number of dynos available, fundamentally what Ryan has found important is to think about the architecture of the site holistically.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More than half of the employees who work on Heroku are remote or distributed employees, meaning Heroku is what you might call remote-first. Host, Chris Castle, brings together five Heroku employees who have had interesting distributed employee experiences. They share some personal stories and discuss setting boundaries, self-awareness, timezones, and some advice for others interested in distributed work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raúl Barroso&lt;/strong&gt; is based in Madrid, Spain. He compares his experience working at Heroku HQ with his current experience as a distributed employee, working from Spain with a team across Europe and the U.S. He also shares his thoughts on the phrase “remote employee” vs “distributed employee” (hint: use “distributed” if you are serious about fostering a culture that values distributed employees as equals to those at HQ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alasdair Monk&lt;/strong&gt; is based in the UK. He published a blog post in September 2016 titled &lt;a href="https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/making-remote-work-b2e2fe53221f"&gt;Making remote work: What we’ve learned at Heroku&lt;/a&gt; discussing distributed work in three categories: working asynchronously, working together, and staying aligned. He reflects on his experience in the past two years since writing that post and also shares his perspective of UX and Design work as a distributed employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon McCartie&lt;/strong&gt; lives way up in northern Idaho by the Canadian border. He and his wife decided to spend 1.5 years with three kids (ages 7, 5, and 2) traveling around the western U.S. in an RV. Oh, and he did this while working on the Customer Support team -- successfully. He shares some fun stories of video meetings with gorgeous views, choosing the right size RV, and using a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot as your family’s primary internet connection.  Here is a picture of Jon’s “office”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://heroku-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/posts/1554994262-mccartie.jpg" alt="A photo of Jon McCartie, working on a hammock in California"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annie Sexton&lt;/strong&gt; currently lives in Austin, TX. For most of 2017, she was a “digital nomad” fulfilling a life-long dream of hers. She started with a month in Thailand, and then went to Japan, Bali, Morocco, Croatia, Slovenia, back to the U.S., and then back to Thailand, and then Panama. Her &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BUZXVw-FVTR/"&gt;Instagram makes it look glamorous&lt;/a&gt;, but she says, “it’s easy to romanticize the lifestyle of working on your laptop on the beach drinking coconut water, but it’s just not like that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Niklas Richardson&lt;/strong&gt; is based in the UK. He shares why and how he put his desk in the garden. He poured a foundation and then bought a pre-fab shed that he had insulated and electrified. Here’s what Niklas’s beautiful backyard office--aka garden oasis--looks like, and also the &lt;a href="https://cabinporn.com/"&gt;website he mentions&lt;/a&gt; in the podcast showcasing other beautiful sheds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Isaac Slavitt is the co-founder of DrivenData, a platform for organizations to solicit help from data scientists to solve real-world problems. DrivenData does this by running &amp;quot;competitions&amp;quot; which asks teams to comb through data sets to solve problems for cash rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such competition was Zamba. Researchers set up cameras in African forests and asked engineering experts to develop AI software which could classify the types of animals which were captured. This would then help with research and conversation efforts without disturbing the natural ecosystem. Another such competition is DengAI, which seeks ML techniques to try and predict future outbreaks of dengue fever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac concludes the interview by talking about DrivenData&amp;#39;s tech stack. He discusses the uses of both R and Python in the data scientist community. He notes that many computationally intensive task, such as ML classification and testing, are able to be offloaded to a service like Paperspace, while the majority of their platform runs on Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nickolas Means likes to tell stories. His conference talks [1] often center around a curious anecdote, but he deftly weaves both technical and organizational relevancy into them. Nickolas talks about how he builds a talk from conception to execution and goes over some fundamentals of good presentation slides. The goal is to provide a narrative without overwhelming the user with too much textual content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He continues with advice for novices and experts alike, including how to craft a CFP that will increase the likelihood of your talk being accepted. He suggests that new speakers choose a larger conference to speak at, rather than a smaller one, as they have more capacity to provide mentoring. Even if you&amp;#39;re not a Ruby or Rails developer, their conferences tend to be very welcoming, and he suggests taking a look at rubyconferences.com to find one that fits.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brendon Murphy, CTO of &lt;a href="https://www.kajabi.com"&gt;Kajabi&lt;/a&gt;, talks about his company&amp;#39;s experience with Dataclips [1]. Instead of requiring developers to connect to their database, everyone in the company is able to generate analytics on-the-fly, and they even democratize the information via a Slackbot. Their marketing team is able to get real-time feedback on their campaigns through Lita.io [2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of using Dataclips dovetails with their preference for using Heroku in general. While they could build their own wrapper to communicate with Postgres, or even manage their own infrastructure, they&amp;#39;ve found that the financial and operational costs are simply not worth it. By offloading this vital work, they free themselves up to focus on building features for their users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brendon concludes by talking about Postgres, and why it&amp;#39;s the right choice for his team. It can act as a NoSQL document store via its JSONB data type, serve as a key-value store obviating the need for Redis, and comes with strict type assurances reducing the need for checks in the software layer. He also mentions add-ons provided by Heroku, such as PGBouncer [3], along with his feature request for how Heroku can better serve Kajabi&amp;#39;s large data needs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode Aaron Patterson joins our own developer advocate Jonan Scheffler to discuss his experiences as an open source developer within GitHub, and explains how he manages to balance his work as a member of the Ruby and Rails core teams with his other responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaron is the only member of both the Ruby and Rails core teams, and he&amp;#39;s been working with Rails since 2005 when his friends attended the No Fluff Just Stuff (NFJS) Pacific Northwest Software Symposium and heard Dave Thomas speak.(1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussing his path to becoming a Ruby developer, Aaron walks through his time working with Perl and Java, covering language regular expression engines (&lt;a href="https://www.pcre.org/"&gt;PCRE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma"&gt;Oniguruma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#POSIX_basic_and_extended"&gt;POSIX&lt;/a&gt;), the joy he felt in finding Ruby, and how falling in love with Ruby eventually forced him to become a C programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the episode Aaron offers some advice to aspiring open source developers and discusses the future of Ruby, along with some features he would like to see around deep freezing data structures(2) and concurrency/parallelism(3). &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Andrew Garcia is the co-founder of &lt;a href="https://pro.goodshuffle.com/"&gt;Goodshuffle&lt;/a&gt;, and as one of the first &lt;a href="https://grails.org/"&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; users on Heroku, he worked closely with Joe Kutner, Heroku&amp;#39;s Java Platform Owner over the years. They chat with Chris Castle, a developer advocate at Heroku, about Goodshuffle&amp;#39;s experience with building a startup on top of the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When building an application, it&amp;#39;s often tempting to reach for the latest and greatest technologies to build your app. Andrew Garcia argues for something different: by using &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://boringtechnology.club/"&gt;boring&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; technology--that is, languages and frameworks that have been around for years, not months--you can iterate much more quickly on features. He&amp;#39;s chosen JDK8 (released in 2014) to run Goodshuffle, a startup founded in 2013 to help event companies manage their business operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodshuffle uses frameworks like &lt;a href="https://gradle.org/"&gt;Gradle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://angularjs.org/"&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt; because of their stance on &lt;a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#convention-over-configuration"&gt;convention over configuration&lt;/a&gt;, which is another opportunity for being more productive. The more reliable the tools you use are, the more you can focus on your users needs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <googleplay:description>&lt;p&gt;Andrew Garcia is the co-founder of &lt;a href="https://pro.goodshuffle.com/"&gt;Goodshuffle&lt;/a&gt;, and as one of the first &lt;a href="https://grails.org/"&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; users on Heroku, he worked closely with Joe Kutner, Heroku&amp;#39;s Java Platform Owner over the years. They chat with Chris Castle, a developer advocate at Heroku, about Goodshuffle&amp;#39;s experience with building a startup on top of the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When building an application, it&amp;#39;s often tempting to reach for the latest and greatest technologies to build your app. Andrew Garcia argues for something different: by using &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://boringtechnology.club/"&gt;boring&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; technology--that is, languages and frameworks that have been around for years, not months--you can iterate much more quickly on features. He&amp;#39;s chosen JDK8 (released in 2014) to run Goodshuffle, a startup founded in 2013 to help event companies manage their business operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodshuffle uses frameworks like &lt;a href="https://gradle.org/"&gt;Gradle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://angularjs.org/"&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt; because of their stance on &lt;a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#convention-over-configuration"&gt;convention over configuration&lt;/a&gt;, which is another opportunity for being more productive. The more reliable the tools you use are, the more you can focus on your users needs.&lt;/p&gt;
